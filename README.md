# CodeWorkstation
This was the senior project of Lukas Rickard and Jake MacMillan. The idea was to create a tool with Qt which made working on small scripts or coding practice problems more efficient and more fun. It basically a UI layer meant to enhance a command line rapid prototyping workflow. It's a good example of some of the things you can do with Qt, but it's not very impressive in it's current state.
