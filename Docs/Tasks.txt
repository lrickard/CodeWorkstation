1) Allow Code Workstation to be run with an arguement that will allow launch with minimal features like -m
   (This should exclude the text editor and the default command box)
    - This will require the default command box to become optional
       - Buttons will default to outputting to the first available command box
       - Buttons must check if there is an available box to output to
    - Save, open, and Save As all need to check if there is a text box existing
